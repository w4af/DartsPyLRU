    """Tests the AutoLRUCache implementation

    This class adds tests for the AutoLRUCache class, 
    which are hard to do in doctest (e.g., due to threading)
    Testing for race conditions and bugs stemming from
    concurrency is notoriously hard. This test case runs 
    enough threads (and iterations per thread) to make
    sure, that there is nothing glaringly obvious wrong
    with the implementation, but it is unlikely to be 
    able to find non-trivial bugs.

    TODO: 
    
      - Need tests for the abandoning stuff (clear with
        parameter discard_loads=True)

      - Need to figure out a way to force a key to be
        loaded concurrently, and exercise the error 
        handling when the loading thread encounters 
        an exception from the loader function. All 
        conurrently running threads loading the same
        key have to abort properly with the error
        signalled by the loader, wrapped as CacheLoadError
        exception.

        This test function tests the nominal behaviour of a
        cache instance, not expecting any exceptions to be 
        raised.

        This test makes sure, that:

        - the logic, which keeps track of keys currently 
          being loaded in a cache, works as advertised, 
          and collapses multiple concurrent read requests
          for the same key into a single `loader` call.

        - nothing is ever evicted if the cache is large 
          enough to accomodate all objects ever being
          requested from it.
